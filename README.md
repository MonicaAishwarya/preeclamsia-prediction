# preeclamsia-prediction

Maternal health is a critical public health concern, and early identification of pregnancy-related risks can significantly reduce maternal mortality.
This project implements a Machine Learning–based Maternal Health Risk Prediction System that classifies pregnant women into Low Risk, Mid Risk, or High Risk categories using physiological parameters.

The system uses ensemble learning techniques and provides model explainability and a user-friendly web interface for real-time risk prediction.
